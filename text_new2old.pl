# Script to convert new orthography text to old orthography using dictionary.
# Version 1.3 by Serge Winitzki. The script is part of the package oldrus-ispell
# and is distributed under GPL as free software.
# Needs a special dictionary and index ("make hugelistA.koi"). Uses the KOI8-C encoding.
# Looks up all words and replaces those found having yat', fita, i.
# If several words match, gives all variants. Preserves case of the first letters of words.

# Usage: text_new2old.pl [-dict=DICTFILE] [-index=INDEXFILE] [-noer] [-onlyone] [-mark=STRING] [-markall] [-readdict] < inputtext > outputtext
# The "-noer" option assumes that no trailing "yer" is desired (the dictionary does not have to conform to this)
# The "-onlyone" option suppresses output of variant spellings, only one variant is given, but word is marked by the "mark string" if several variants were possible
# The "-mark=..." option sets the string which will be used to mark variants. Default is asterisk "*"
# The "-dict=..." option sets dictionary file name (default "./hugelistA.koi")
# The "-index=..." option sets index file name (default "./hugelistA.idx")
# The "-markall" option additionally marks all words that were not found in the dictionary
# The "-readdict" option makes the script load the whole dictionary at once; this may be faster if a lot of RAM is available (about 40MB of *free* RAM). Default is not to load the whole dictionary but read parts of it from the file when necessary.

# Version history:
# 1.0	initial release, basic functionality
# 1.1	faster dictionary loading, bugfixes, improvements, needs less memory
# 1.2	reworked dictionary handling: now uses separately created index file (separate script "mkhugeidx.pl"), does not load the dictionary into memory (the OS will cache the file anyway), which reduces memory consumption and is faster when memory is low (unless -readdict option is given which may be faster if at least 40 MB of *free* RAM is available).
# 1.3	added some rules for words with "yo" that gets replaced by "yat'"
