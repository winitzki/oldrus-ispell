This is a rough readme file for creating a Russian dictionary for ispell.

You will first need to get ispell 3.0+ it is available from
ftp.cs.ucla.edu [131.179.128.34]  In local.h comment out NO8BIT.

By default the dictionary is in KOI-8 encoding, but I may change this.
The dictionary and the russian.aff can made in GOSTCII/ISO 8859-5 or
ALT (Bryabrin's Al'ternativnyj variant).  NOTE: xterm doesn't seem to
like ALT.

BUILDING:

  To build you must have buildhash in your $PATH and have cc and sed.

  1) Edit Makefile and make sure LIB is the directory where ispell will
     look for the dictionary.
  2) Make the appropriate encode for your system.  (KOI-8 (default),
     GOST/ISO, or ALT).  To do this use make GOST ISO ALT or KOI8
     (default with just make).
     make GOST
     make ALT
     make
  3) make install

TO USE:

	type 'ispell -d russian <filename>'
